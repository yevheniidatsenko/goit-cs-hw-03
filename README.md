# Homework Assignment: Introduction to Database Management Systems

## Overview

This assignment consists of two independent tasks designed to enhance your understanding of SQL and NoSQL database management systems. You will create a task management database using PostgreSQL and implement a Python script to interact with MongoDB.

## Task 1: PostgreSQL Database for Task Management System

### Objectives

- Design and implement a relational database schema for a task management system.
- Perform essential SQL queries to interact with the database.

### Requirements

#### Database Schema

- **`users` table:**
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-increment (`SERIAL`).
  - `fullname`: Full name of the user (`VARCHAR(100)`).
  - `email`: Unique email address (`VARCHAR(100)`).
- **`status` table:**
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-increment (`SERIAL`).
  - `name`: Unique status name (`VARCHAR(50)`). Example statuses: `new`, `in progress`, `completed`.
- **`tasks` table:**
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-increment (`SERIAL`).
  - `title`: Task title (`VARCHAR(100)`).
  - `description`: Task description (`TEXT`).
  - `status_id`: Foreign key referencing `status.id` (`INTEGER`).
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing `users.id` (`INTEGER`).

#### Constraints

- Unique constraints on `users.email` and `status.name`.
- Cascade delete: Deleting a user removes all their tasks.

### Deliverables

- Python scripts:
  1. **Schema creation script:** Generates the required tables.
  2. **Data population script:** Uses the `Faker` library to seed tables with sample data.
  3. **SQL queries script:** Executes the following operations:
     - Retrieve tasks by user.
     - Retrieve tasks by status.
     - Update task status.
     - Find users without tasks.
     - Add new tasks.
     - Retrieve incomplete tasks.
     - Delete tasks by ID.
     - Search users by email.
     - Update user information.
     - Count tasks by status.
     - Filter tasks by email domain.
     - List tasks without descriptions.
     - Join users and tasks with a specific status.
     - Group users and count tasks.

## Task 2: MongoDB CRUD Operations

### Objectives

- Implement basic CRUD operations using MongoDB and the PyMongo library.

### Requirements

#### Database Structure

Each document should include the following fields:

```json
{
    "_id": ObjectId("example_id"),
    "name": "barsik",
    "age": 3,
    "features": ["plays with toys", "friendly", "orange"]
}
```

    -	_id: Unique identifier for each document (auto-generated by MongoDB).
    -	name: Name of the cat (string).
    -	age: Age of the cat (integer).
    -	features: List of characteristics of the cat (array of strings).

#### Python Script Deliverables

The Python script should include the following functionalities:

Read Operations 1. Fetch all documents from the collection:
Retrieve all records currently stored in the MongoDB collection. 2. Retrieve a specific document by the name of the cat:
Allow users to search for a document by providing the cat’s name.

Update Operations 1. Update the age of a cat by its name:
Modify the age field of a specific document based on the cat’s name. 2. Add a new feature to a cat’s features list by its name:
Append a new value to the features array of a specific document based on the cat’s name.
